# the flocking station

An visualization of a 4k pixel space that many flocks inhabit. A boyds visualizer. With serval
weird features. Pluck a boyd from the flock and upload it to a portable universon on the nyaa-os.

There is a multi processor system with a desktop pc environment that a boyd can be plucked from
and evolved further on the go.

## Boyd-x-CAs
each boid has a small 2d 1bit image and a small ca program that runs and draws to it. In a 
sense it is the boyds micro cosmos. Its space where its internal processes are evolving.
Turning and spiting out image files.
